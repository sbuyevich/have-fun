# Have-Fun V0 Specification

## Summary

Have-Fun is a local client-server party game app. One person hosts the server on a Windows or Mac computer, and all players join from browsers on the same LAN by opening a shared local URL.

V1 includes one game: Word Scramble. The Game Master selects a predefined sentence, starts a round, and watches player results on a dashboard. Players reconstruct the original sentence by clicking shuffled words in the correct order.

## Goals

- Run without cloud deployment, paid services, accounts, or external infrastructure.
- Let friends play together from phones, tablets, or computers on the same LAN.
- Keep all game state in server memory.
- Make the Game Master flow fast enough to run repeated rounds.
- Build the app so more games can be added later.

## Non-Goals

- No public internet hosting in V1.
- No database or persistent storage in V1.
- No user accounts, passwords, or authentication in V1.
- No support for players outside the host computer's LAN.
- No custom sentence editing from the browser in V1.

## Core Flow

1. Host starts the server on a Windows or Mac computer.
2. Server displays or exposes a local LAN URL.
3. Game Master opens the shared URL and enters the configured master name.
4. App opens the master dashboard.
5. Players open the shared URL and enter unique display names.
6. Game Master selects a predefined sentence.
7. Game Master starts the round.
8. Server shuffles the sentence words for the round.
9. Players select words in order to reconstruct the sentence.
10. Each player submits the completed sentence.
11. Dashboard updates with results.
12. Dashboard ranks players.
13. Game Master starts another round.

## Word Scramble Rules

- A round is based on one predefined sentence.
- The server splits the sentence into words.
- The server sends players the words in shuffled order.
- Players click one available word at a time.
- Clicked words move into the player's collected sentence.
- Players can see their collected sentence while playing.
- A player finishes when all words are selected.
- The result is the ordered list of selected words joined back into a sentence.
- Correctness is based on how many words are in the correct position.
- A fully correct answer has every word in the same position as the original sentence.
- Ranking is by correctness first, then shortest spent time.

## Data

### App Settings

The master name is configured in `appsettings.json`.

Recommended shape:

```json
{
  "Game": {
    "MasterName": "master"
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `Game:MasterName` must be non-empty.
- Name matching uses the trimmed submitted name.
- The master name comparison is case-insensitive.

### Sentence Source

Predefined sentences are stored in a JSON file.

Recommended shape:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "timeLimitInSeconds": 30
  }
]
```

Rules:

- `text` must be non-empty.
- `timeLimitInSeconds` limits how long a player has to finish the text.
- Sentences are loaded when the server starts.

### In-Memory State

The server keeps all state in memory.

Required state:

- Connected Game Master name.
- Connected player names.
- Current round id.
- Selected sentence id and text.
- Shuffled words for the current round.
- Round start time.
- Player submissions.
- Player spent time.
- Player correctness score.

Restart behavior:

- Restarting the server clears all connected users, rounds, and submissions.

## Local Network Behavior

- The server must listen on a local HTTP port.
- The app must provide a join URL usable by other devices on the same LAN.
- The URL should use the host computer's LAN IP address when possible.
- If LAN IP detection is unavailable, the app should still run on localhost for testing.

## Tech Stack 
- All code should be in src folder 
- App should use Blazor with InteractiveServer render mode. 
- Solution name is `HaveFun` has 2 projects
  - `HaveFun.Web` - UI
  - `HaveFun.Core` - backend
